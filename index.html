                    <div class="quote">"Fish are hard to catch. You have to think like a fish, which is tough because fish are dumb. You have to be dumb to catch fish." -Martin</div>
                    <div class="quote">"Fish are super slippery. There's nothing you can do about that. I suggest using a net of some sort." -Martin</div>
                    <div class="quote">"This doesn't have to do with fish as much as it does about self-care: wear sunscreen. I once spent a day in the hospital with second-degree sunburns. It wasn't pretty." -Martin</div>
                    <div class="quote">"Don't eat sushi in front of your fish. I can't be sure, but I don't think they like it." -Martin</div>

                        <ul class="tips">
                            <li>Keep water between 60 and 90 degrees fahrenheit. This ensures all fish are within their optimal water temperatures.</li>
                            <li>Change the water temperature frequently. This allows all fish to feel comfortable at some point.</li>
                            <li>Windex the inside and outside of the tank frequently. This allows you to see the fish better (and they can see you better, too).</li>
                            <li>Throw theme parties. Fish love a good party.</li>
                            <li>Change the arrangement of your tank weekly. This simulates the ever-changing ocean the fish are accustomed to.</li>
